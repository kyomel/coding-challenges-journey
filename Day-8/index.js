// Question: Build a Live Commenting System
// Requirements:
// Frontend Setup: Design the HTML and CSS for the comment section including the input field.
// Backend Integration: Establish a server to manage incoming and outgoing messages in real-time.
// Real-Time Data Handling: Utilize WebSockets to ensure data is sent and received instantly.

// Solution:
// 1. Frontend Development: We designed a clean and functional user interface using HTML and CSS for the commenting section. JavaScript was used to handle events like comment submissions and to dynamically display new comments without page refreshes. check answer.html
// 2. Backend Setup: Using Node.js and the WebSocket protocol, we set up a server that listens for new messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients. This ensures that comments are shared in real-time. check socket.js
