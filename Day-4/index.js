// Question: Harness External APIs to Build a Weather Forecasting App
// Solution:
// API Integration: We used the OpenWeatherMap API, known for its comprehensive data on current weather, forecasts, and historical data. This API was chosen due to its robust documentation and ease of use.
// User Interface: We designed a simple web interface where users can input a city name or ZIP code. This interface is responsive and user-friendly, ensuring a good user experience across devices.
// Fetching and Displaying Data: The application makes HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. We handled the API responses with JavaScript and displayed the weather data dynamically on the webpage.
// Step:
// 1. Registering for an API Key: First, we obtained an API key from OpenWeatherMap by registering on their platform.
// 2. Building the User Interface: We created an HTML form for user input and a display area for weather information. Hereâ€™s a snippet for the user interface check file solution html
// 3. Fetching Weather Data: Using JavaScript, we set up the Fetch API to request weather data from OpenWeatherMap and process the response to update the user interface accordingly.
